 'You need French export papers, a live-animal booking, and a MOCCAE import permit that is still valid when the pet lands. The permit lasts 90 days from issuance. Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) is the airport to book first. Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE) work only after that airport accepts the crate. Air France may offer cabin or cargo.

 rulesSpecialties:
 'France to Dubai pairs a French export certificate with a MOCCAE import permit. A French official veterinarian, the vétérinaire sanitaire, endorses papers that name the animal, the ISO microchip and the rabies vaccine. The permit is valid for 90 days from issuance, and the pet must enter the UAE inside that window. Check the MOCCAE portal before you treat a French origin as exempt from a rabies antibody test. Fit the microchip before the rabies vaccine you will cite. Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) is the usual long-haul cargo airport. Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE) each need a confirmed live-animal desk. Air France is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo. Most dogs and cats enter as cargo at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC). Abu Dhabi (AUH) is the arrival only on an Etihad ticket.',
 difficulties:
 'The booking usually fails on the airport. A passenger ticket from Nice (NCE) or Paris Orly (ORY) does not open a crate desk, and many long-haul pets still leave from Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). Lyon (LYS) is useful only when the carrier confirms a desk that week. Air France cabin rules inside Europe do not place the dog in the cabin into Dubai. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo, and a Qatar Airways connection in Doha needs its own live-animal acceptance. The permit fails when the flight slips past 90 days from issuance. The microchip on the French papers must be the chip on the MOCCAE file. In Dubai, collect from cargo at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC). Abu Dhabi (AUH) applies only to an Etihad itinerary. Tell us about your move before you pay for a seat the airline has not accepted for the animal.',
 howItWorks:
 'For most pets the airport is Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). Ask the carrier about Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE) before you plan the drive. Fit the ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine you will use, and check the MOCCAE portal for a rabies antibody test. A French official veterinarian then endorses the export papers. Apply for the import permit so the 90 days from issuance still cover the cargo date. Book Air France, Emirates, Etihad or Qatar Airways only after that carrier confirms the animal. Air France is listed as cabin or cargo, and the Gulf carriers are listed as cargo. A Qatar Airways routing via Doha needs a confirmed connection for the crate. In the final week, complete any parasite treatment on the current MOCCAE checklist and check the crate fit. Release in the UAE is through cargo at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC).',
 airportsNarrative:
 'French airports on this route are Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE). CDG is the long-haul cargo airport most trips toward the Gulf use. ORY is in the same city and a different operation, so an Orly ticket is not a Charles de Gaulle crate booking. Lyon can take a pet when the carrier confirms a live-animal desk, and many pets from eastern France still travel by road to CDG. Nice has frequent passenger flights and a thinner crate service, so confirm the flight before you rely on it. In the UAE, Dubai International (DXB) is often the name on the passenger ticket while the animal clears in cargo. Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) is the other Dubai cargo clearance, including many Emirates cargo bookings. Abu Dhabi (AUH) is the arrival only when Etihad is the carrier. Put the same code on the French certificate, the airway bill and the MOCCAE file.',
 airlinesNarrative:
 'Airlines on this route are Air France, Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways. Air France is listed as cabin or cargo. A cabin product inside Europe does not become a cabin seat into Dubai, so read the current Air France page for this city pair, including breed and crate limits. Emirates is listed as cargo. Confirm whether the crate is labelled Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) before anyone books a hotel near the passenger terminal. Etihad is listed as cargo. If a small-pet cabin product exists into Abu Dhabi (AUH) on your dates, verify it on the Etihad page. It is not the default from Paris. Qatar Airways is listed as cargo and often connects in Doha, which is a second handling for the animal. Dubai Pet Relocation coordinates the file. The airline decides whether the pet travels.',

 question: 'Which French airports actually export pets toward Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) is the airport to plan first. Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE) can work after the airline and the handler confirm a live-animal desk on that date. A Riviera passenger flight does not include a crate. Ask for the flight number before you book family tickets around Nice or Orly. If that desk says no, move the crate to CDG.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Does a Nice or Orly passenger ticket include a crate desk?',
 answer:
 'A passenger ticket at Nice (NCE) or Paris Orly (ORY) does not include a crate desk. Both airports are alternates, and many long-haul pets still reposition to Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). Ask the carrier whether that flight number accepts a live animal before you promise a Nice or Orly departure. Lyon (LYS) needs the same check.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Will the pet clear with me at Dubai passenger arrivals?',
 answer:
 'On a cargo booking, the pet clears through cargo and the veterinary release at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC). That is a different building from the passenger baggage hall. Ask the handler where to collect after MOCCAE release, and use the airport code written on the airway bill.',

 'Air France is listed as cabin or cargo, and that listing is not a cabin seat into Dubai. Most dogs and cats arrive as cargo. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo on this route. Confirm the live policy for your exact France to UAE trip, including breed and crate size, before you buy the ticket.',
 },
 {
 question: 'How long does the MOCCAE import permit last on a France departure?',
 answer:
 'The MOCCAE import permit is valid for 90 days from issuance. The pet must enter the UAE inside that window. A French pet passport does not replace it, and a later Charles de Gaulle cargo date can use up the permit if you wait too long after it is issued. Apply when the flight date is real.',
 },
 {
 question: 'When must the rabies titer blood be drawn for France to Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Check the MOCCAE portal before you skip a rabies antibody test for a French origin. When a test is required, the result must be at least 0.5 IU/ml; the certificate is valid for 365 days if the vaccine stays valid and continuous and no booster is given; otherwise repeat the test; a first vaccine or a gap needs at least 21 days before the test, and a valid booster does not; this is not a 90-day sample window.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Is a French pet passport enough for UAE entry?',
 answer:
 'An EU pet passport helps show identity and vaccine history. UAE entry still needs a MOCCAE import permit and French health papers that match the microchip. The passport does not accept the crate at Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and it does not clear cargo at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC).',

 'Dubai to France is planned from the French point of entry, usually Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). European Commission rules for a non-commercial move ask for an ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine, a valid rabies course, and a 21-day wait after a primary course. An official or authorised veterinarian issues the EU animal health certificate inside the entry window, commonly about 10 days. The Commission currently lists the UAE among countries whose dogs, cats and ferrets can skip rabies antibody titration for non-commercial entry. Open the live list before you skip the test. More than five pets with one traveller can move the file onto commercial or Balai rules. Only then do you request MOCCAE exit papers. Export certificates are often discussed as valid for about 30 days from issuance, so check the portal. Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE) are possible only when that border post accepts the crate.',
 difficulties:
 'The crate is inspected at the French airport named on the EU certificate. For most bookings that is Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). A plan to meet family at Nice (NCE) or Paris Orly (ORY) works only if the airline and the border post both accept live animals there. Lyon (LYS) is the same kind of check. A MOCCAE import permit is for pets entering the UAE, so the useful UAE paper here is the export certificate. Issue it too early and the short window, often discussed as about 30 days from issuance, can end before departure. Air France is listed as cabin or cargo from some products. Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo, and a Doha connection needs its own confirmation. A train after a confirmed CDG release can reach Lyon. It does not change the airport on the certificate.',

Decide whether the move is non-commercial or commercial, and read the live European Commission list before you skip a rabies antibody test for a pet from the UAE. Fit the ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine, and finish the 21-day wait after a primary course. An authorised veterinarian then issues the EU animal health certificate inside the entry window, commonly about 10 days. Shortlist Air France, Emirates, Etihad or Qatar Airways from Dubai International (DXB), Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) or Abu Dhabi (AUH), and confirm that product into the French airport.

 airportsNarrative:
 'French arrival airports on this route are Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) and Nice (NCE). CDG is the long-haul veterinary border most Air France and Gulf cargo products can name. ORY is the same city on a map and a separate question for a crate, so confirm live-animal arrival before family waits at Orly. Lyon suits a home in the east of France only when the carrier and the border post both work there. Many pets still land at CDG and continue by road. Nice is a passenger airport first. Leaving the UAE, Dubai International (DXB) is the common passenger airport and often still ships the animal as cargo. Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) is the cargo departure when that Emirates product is booked. Abu Dhabi (AUH) is the departure when the ticket is Etihad. Name the same French code on the EU certificate and the airway bill.',

Read the current Air France pet page for Dubai to France, including breed and crate limits, before you tell family to meet you at a passenger gate. Emirates is listed as cargo. Do not treat a screenshot from another city pair as permission for this one. Etihad is listed as cargo. An Abu Dhabi (AUH) product, if you are using one, still has to meet French entry at the airport on the certificate. Qatar Airways is listed as cargo and usually means a live-animal transfer in Doha. Dubai Pet Relocation coordinates the file and does not fly the aircraft. Ask the carrier to confirm the product before you pay.',
 faqs: [
 {
 question: 'Is Dubai to France just France to Dubai with the names swapped?',

The order of the papers does not. Start with the European Commission pet rules and the French airport that will inspect the crate.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Do I need a MOCCAE import permit to fly from Dubai to Paris?',
 answer:
 'A MOCCAE import permit is for a pet entering the UAE. This journey needs a MOCCAE export health certificate timed to the EU animal health certificate. Confirm the current digital service on the MOCCAE portal, and keep the export certificate inside its validity on the day you leave Dubai International (DXB) or the cargo airport you actually use.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Which French airport should the crate actually land at?',
 answer:
 'Plan Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) unless the airline and the French veterinary border both accept Paris Orly (ORY), Lyon (LYS) or Nice (NCE). A house near Nice is not a reason to print NCE on the certificate. Ask the carrier which airport code is on the live-animal booking, then use that same code on the EU papers.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Does France still skip a rabies titer for pets coming from the UAE?',
 answer:
 'For non-commercial entry, the European Commission currently lists the UAE among countries whose dogs, cats and ferrets can enter without a rabies antibody test. Lists change, so open the live page before you skip the lab. You still need the microchip before the vaccine, a valid rabies course, and the EU certificate. A primary course usually needs 21 days. More than five pets can bring commercial or Balai rules.',

 {
 question: 'Can we land the crate in Nice and take the train to Lyon?',
 answer:
 'Only if a live-animal product into Nice (NCE) exists and the EU certificate names NCE. The usual plan is Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG). A train from a confirmed CDG cargo release to Lyon is a ground trip. It does not make Orly (ORY) or Nice the point of entry, and it does not move the inspection.',

 {
 question: 'What UAE paper do I show on departure day to France?',
 answer:
 'Show the MOCCAE export health certificate, aligned to the dates on the EU animal health certificate. An import permit is the wrong document on the way out. The export window is often discussed as about 30 days from issuance. Check the portal before the vet signs, so the paper still covers departure day.',

 'Dubai to the Netherlands is planned from one point of entry: Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS). European Commission rules ask for an ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine, a valid course, and a 21-day wait after a primary vaccination. An official or authorised veterinarian issues the EU animal health certificate inside the entry window, commonly about 10 days. The Commission currently lists the UAE among countries whose dogs, cats and ferrets can skip rabies antibody titration for non-commercial entry. Open the live list before you skip the lab. More than five pets with one traveller can move the trip onto commercial or Balai rules. Then request MOCCAE exit papers. Export certificates are often discussed as valid for about 30 days from issuance. Check the portal. There is no second Dutch arrival code. If AMS cannot take the animal that week, Eindhoven is not the substitute. KLM is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates and Etihad are listed as cargo from the UAE.',
 difficulties:
 'Two misses are common. One is a random KLM passenger seat into Amsterdam Schiphol (AMS), on the hope that the animal building will absorb an unmarked crate. The building is not the booking. The other is a plan to import through Rotterdam or Eindhoven because someone will collect from another city. This list has AMS only. Maastricht is not on it either. A MOCCAE import permit does not apply on the way out. The export certificate, often about 30 days from issuance, can end before the EU certificate and the AMS slot line up. KLM is listed as cabin or cargo, which you reconfirm from Dubai. Emirates and Etihad are listed as cargo. A short drive after release is normal in the Netherlands. It does not create a second import airport. If AMS is closed to the crate that week, change the date or use a gateway in another country.',

The booking still has to be a pet product, and the EU certificate has to name this point of entry. Rotterdam The Hague, Eindhoven and Maastricht are not pet-import airports here.

Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) is the cargo departure when that product is booked. Abu Dhabi (AUH) is the departure when the ticket is Etihad.

A Rome family refuses Malpensa and misses the only Gulf desk that week. ITA Airways cabin language on European sectors does not authorise cabin into Dubai. Emirates and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo, and Doha is another live-animal transfer. The permit fails if you wait for a later ITA or Emirates flight outside 90 days from issuance.

Book ITA Airways, Emirates or Qatar Airways only after that carrier accepts the pet. ITA is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates and Qatar Airways are listed as cargo. If ITA says no, the fallback is Emirates or Qatar from FCO or MXP, not a Linate hop. A Qatar connection via Doha needs its own confirmation.

 airportsNarrative:
 'Italian export airports on this route are Rome Fiumicino (FCO), Milan Malpensa (MXP) and Milan Linate (LIN). FCO is the long-haul airport for central and southern Italy, and a common ITA and Gulf cargo path. MXP is the northern long-haul airport. Malpensa cargo is not Linate. LIN is the city airport and needs a direct yes before you use it. North of the Apennines usually means MXP. Lazio and the south usually mean FCO. Do not split the difference at Linate. In the UAE, Dubai International (DXB) may be on the passenger ticket while the crate clears in cargo. Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) is the other cargo clearance. Abu Dhabi (AUH) is not an Italy default, because Etihad is not listed. A cousin at Fiumicino will not collect a Malpensa crate.

 airlinesNarrative:
 'Airlines on this route are ITA Airways, Emirates and Qatar Airways. ITA is listed as cabin or cargo out of Rome Fiumicino (FCO), and sometimes Milan. That is not a cabin right into Dubai. Read the current ITA pet page for Italy to the UAE, not an Alitalia forum post, for crate limits and whether the product is cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. The FCO desk and the Malpensa (MXP) desk are different, so name the same code on the MOCCAE file. Qatar Airways is listed as cargo and may connect in Doha, which you confirm as a transfer.

 'Airlines on this route are Aer Lingus, Emirates and Ryanair. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. That is not a cabin seat into Dubai. Read the current Aer Lingus page for Ireland to the UAE, including crate and breed limits, and expect cargo unless the page says otherwise for your flight. Emirates is listed as cargo from Dublin, or from Cork only if a real product exists there. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Do not brief the family that everyone does it. A seat already bought for the people does not change that. Dubai Pet Relocation coordinates the file and does not fly the aircraft. Confirm Aer Lingus or Emirates before you pay for the crate.',

 {
 question: 'Can Ryanair take the dog from Dublin to Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Do not plan on Ryanair. It is listed as generally not accepting pets. Use a carrier that publishes a live-animal product, which on this route means confirming Aer Lingus or Emirates. If someone tells you otherwise, ask the airline for the written policy on that flight. A passenger booking is not a crate.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Dublin or Cork for the export?',
 answer:
 'Dublin (DUB) is the primary airport. Cork (ORK) needs an explicit live-animal confirmation. A Munster passenger flight does not carry the crate by itself. Shannon is not on this list, so do not add it as a backup when Dublin is full. Most pets still leave from DUB.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Can Aer Lingus cabin the pet into Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo, and that is not a cabin seat into Dubai. Most dogs and cats travel as cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. Confirm the live policy for Ireland to the UAE, including the breed and the crate, before you buy the ticket.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Will the pet clear at DXB passenger arrivals from Dublin?',
 answer:
 'On manifest cargo, expect cargo and veterinary release at Dubai International (DXB) or Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC). The passenger baggage hall is the wrong meeting point. Ask the handler where to collect after MOCCAE release. A Dublin ticket that says DXB can still mean the cargo village.',
 },
 {
 question: 'How long is the MOCCAE import permit from an Irish departure?',
 answer:
 'The MOCCAE import permit is valid for 90 days from issuance. The pet must enter the UAE inside that window. Dublin has fewer live-animal flights than a large hub, so a slipped date after issuance is expensive. Apply when you have a realistic Aer Lingus or Emirates cargo date.',
 },
 {
 question: 'When should the titer blood be drawn for Ireland to Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Check the MOCCAE portal before you skip a rabies antibody test for an Irish origin. When a test is required, the result must be at least 0.5 IU/ml; the certificate is valid for 365 days if the vaccine stays valid and continuous and no booster is given; otherwise repeat the test; a first vaccine or a gap needs at least 21 days before the test, and a valid booster does not; this is not a 90-day sample window.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Is an Irish EU pet passport enough for UAE entry?',
 answer:
 'An Irish EU pet passport helps with identity and vaccine history. UAE entry still needs a MOCCAE import permit and origin papers that match the microchip. The passport does not accept the crate at Dublin (DUB), and it does not replace cargo clearance in Dubai.',

 intro:
 'A move from Dubai to Ireland starts with EU entry at Dublin (DUB), then UAE export papers. Cork (ORK) is possible only if live-animal import there is real. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. The microchip comes before the rabies vaccine, and an authorised veterinarian issues the EU certificate inside a short window, commonly about 10 days. Ireland uses EU pet movement. Great Britain tapeworm rules do not copy across by default. With the Dublin date firm, time the MOCCAE export certificate to departure. Tell us about your move.',
 snippetQuestion: 'How do I take a pet from Dubai to Dublin?',
 snippetAnswer:
 'Build the EU animal health certificate for Dublin (DUB) first, the MOCCAE export certificate second, and a live-animal booking third. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets, so it is not the plan. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. Cork (ORK) only if that import is confirmed. The microchip comes before the rabies vaccine. A MOCCAE import permit is for pets entering the UAE.',
 hubCardDesc: 'EU entry at Dublin, then a UAE export certificate. Not a Ryanair seat.',
 destinationRules: EU_DEST('Ireland', 'DUB, ORK'),
 rulesSpecialties:
 'Dubai to Ireland is planned from an Irish point of entry, almost always Dublin (DUB). European Commission rules ask for an ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine, a valid course, and a 21-day wait after a primary vaccination. The Commission currently lists the UAE among countries whose dogs, cats and ferrets can skip rabies antibody titration for non-commercial entry. Open the live list before you skip the lab. More than five pets with one traveller can move onto commercial or Balai rules. Great Britain tapeworm rules, including Echinococcus treatment aimed at Britain, do not automatically apply at Dublin. Then request MOCCAE exit papers. Export certificates are often discussed as valid for about 30 days from issuance. Check the portal. Cork (ORK) stays unconfirmed unless import there is real. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo.',
 difficulties:
 'Three misses show up. Families buy Ryanair seats and assume the crate can follow. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Others name Cork (ORK) because the house is in Munster, then find the certificate and the airline only work at Dublin (DUB). A third is pasting a Great Britain tapeworm timetable, or a GOV.UK checklist, onto an Irish file. Ireland is in the EU pet-movement framework, not a British arrival. A MOCCAE import permit does not apply on the way out. The export certificate, often about 30 days from issuance, can expire while you wait for the next Dublin live-animal flight. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo, which you reconfirm from Dubai. Emirates is listed as cargo. Shannon is not on this list. A road after Dublin is the normal way to reach Cork.',
 howItWorks:
 'Retire a Ryanair plan at the start. Lock Dublin (DUB) unless a carrier and the Irish point of entry both accept Cork (ORK). Decide if the arrival is non-commercial or commercial, and read the live European Commission list before you skip a rabies antibody test. Read the Irish and EU notes for dogs instead of a Great Britain tapeworm printout. Fit the ISO microchip before the rabies vaccine, and finish the 21-day wait after a primary course. An authorised veterinarian issues the EU certificate for DUB inside the entry window, commonly about 10 days. Shortlist Aer Lingus or Emirates from Dubai International (DXB), Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC), or Abu Dhabi (AUH) only if that routing exists. Etihad is not listed here. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. Ryanair stays generally not pets. With the Irish date firm, request the MOCCAE export certificate so it covers a thinner Dublin calendar.',
 airportsNarrative:
 'Irish arrival airports on this route are Dublin (DUB) and Cork (ORK). DUB is the long-haul live-animal arrival most Aer Lingus and Emirates products can name. ORK is a Munster hope unless the carrier and the Irish veterinary border both accept the animal there. Shannon is not on this list. Most families collect in Dublin and continue by road. That drive is not a second import airport. Leaving the UAE, a DXB passenger ticket often still moves the animal as cargo. Al Maktoum / Dubai World Central (DWC) is the cargo alternative when that product is booked. Abu Dhabi (AUH) is not a default to Dublin, because Etihad is not listed. Write DUB on the EU certificate unless ORK is truly confirmed. Dublin collection is a cargo briefing. Cork remains a confirmation problem. Shannon stays off the paperwork.',
 airlinesNarrative:
 'Confirm Aer Lingus, Emirates and Ryanair again for a departure from the UAE. An Ireland to Dubai acceptance does not transfer, and Ryanair does not become an option in either direction. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo into Dublin (DUB). That is not a cabin promise out of Dubai. Read the live Aer Lingus pet page for this city pair. Emirates is listed as cargo, with its own handler path and a thinner weekday pattern than a huge continental hub. Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Do not put it in the plan as the crate carrier. Dubai Pet Relocation coordinates the file and does not fly the aircraft. Ask Aer Lingus or Emirates to confirm the animal before you pay.',
 faqs: [
 {
 question: 'Is Dubai to Ireland the reverse of Ireland to Dubai?',
 answer:
 'Leaving Dubai is EU entry at Dublin plus a UAE export certificate. Coming from Ireland is a MOCCAE import permit and cargo release in the UAE. Ryanair is the wrong plan in both directions. It is listed as generally not accepting pets. Start with a carrier that publishes a live-animal product into Dublin (DUB).',
 },
 {
 question: 'Can Ryanair take the pet from Dubai to Dublin?',
 answer:
 'Ryanair is listed as generally not accepting pets. Confirm the current policy if you were told otherwise, and do not plan on it. Aer Lingus is listed as cabin or cargo. Emirates is listed as cargo. A seat for the people on a low-cost flight does not move the crate from Dubai to Dublin.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Do I need a MOCCAE import permit to leave Dubai for Ireland?',
 answer:
 'An import permit is for a pet entering the UAE. Leaving for Ireland needs a MOCCAE export health certificate timed to the EU animal health certificate. Confirm the portal path. The export window is short, often discussed as about 30 days from issuance, and it has to cover departure.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Does Ireland require a rabies titer from the UAE?',
 answer:
 'For non-commercial EU entry, the European Commission currently treats the UAE as exempt from rabies antibody titration for dogs, cats and ferrets. Verify the live list before you skip a test. You still need the microchip before the vaccine, a valid course, and the EU certificate inside its entry window. A primary course usually needs 21 days.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Can the crate arrive in Cork instead of Dublin?',
 answer:
 'Only if live-animal import at Cork (ORK) is real for your carrier and the EU certificate names that point of entry. The default is Dublin (DUB). A road transfer after Dublin is the usual way to reach Munster. Shannon is not an alternate on this route.',
 },
 {
 question: 'Do Great Britain tapeworm rules apply at Dublin?',
 answer:
 'Do not copy a GOV.UK Great Britain checklist onto an Irish arrival. Ireland is in the EU pet-movement framework. Tapeworm treatment aimed at Britain, including Echinococcus timing, does not automatically apply at Dublin. Read the Irish and EU certificate notes for dogs and follow what that document requires.',
 },
 {
 question: 'What UAE paper do I need on departure day to Dublin?',
 answer:
 'Take the MOCCAE export health certificate, aligned to the EU certificate dates. An import permit is the wrong paper on the way out. Validity is a short window, often discussed as about 30 days from issuance. Check the portal before you book the Dublin flight, because the live-animal calendar is thinner than at a huge hub.',
