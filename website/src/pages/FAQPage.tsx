If you are experienced with international pet travel, have time to research MOCCAE requirements, and are confident managing vet appointments, crate purchases, and airline cargo bookings, you may be able to do it yourself. However, most pet owners find that the risk of a missed document, incorrect timeline, or unexpected airline restriction is worth the cost of professional guidance.</p>,

On 22 September 2026 the United Kingdom was on the MOCCAE low-risk list and the United States was not named on it. Confirm any other origin on the live portal before you skip the test.

Your pet must also be at least 12 weeks old at the time of its rabies vaccination, and that vaccine must be at least 21 days old at the time of travel.

    answer: <p>Yes, this is a common and costly mistake. The microchip must be implanted before the rabies vaccination. If your pet was vaccinated before being microchipped, MOCCAE treats the vaccination as invalid for UAE entry. You will need to re-vaccinate after microchipping and wait another 21 days before travel. We check the order of these records early so the problem surfaces while there is still time to fix it.</p>,

    plain: 'There is no single published fare. The quote separates government charges, the clinic, the airline, the crate, handling, and coordination. On 22 September 2026 MOCCAE listed AED 200 to issue an import permit for one animal, AED 500 to release one dog, and AED 250 to release one cat.

    question: 'What are the government fees for importing a pet?',
    answer: <p>MOCCAE charges an import permit fee and an arrival veterinary release/inspection fee — confirm both current amounts on the official portal, because published figures have differed. On top of that you typically pay Dubai customs clearance, Dubai Municipality registration, and microchipping if it has not already been done. Those government charges are the same whichever coordinator you use.</p>,

    question: 'Why is air cargo so expensive compared to my own flight ticket?',
    answer: <p>Pets travel as manifest cargo, not as baggage, so they ride in a climate-controlled, pressurized section of the cargo hold. The fee covers dedicated cargo space your pet's crate displaces, climate control and pressurization throughout the flight, ground handling at both airports, insurance and liability coverage for live animals, and IATA-compliant handling. Cargo is also charged by volumetric weight — a formula using the crate's length, width, and height — which is why crate size matters so much. It costs more than an economy seat because it requires specialized infrastructure, but it is the safest way for pets to fly long distances.</p>,

    question: 'How long does pet relocation to Dubai take?',
    answer: <p>A first rabies vaccine, or a gap, needs at least 21 days before travel. The MOCCAE import permit is valid for 90 days from issuance, and the pet must arrive inside that window. The health certificate is issued close to travel. When a titer is required, use a result of at least 0.5 IU/ml and a certificate valid for 365 days if the vaccine stays valid and continuous and no booster is given. There is no single week-count that fits every route. Send the pet and the dates and we will say which clock applies.</p>,

Starting early gives you more flight options, lower costs, and time to handle unexpected issues without stress. In peak season (October to May), booking 8–12 weeks in advance also secures the best cargo rates and routing.</p>,

The permit is valid for 90 days from issuance.

    answer: <p>Last-minute relocations are possible from low-risk countries if all documents are already in order, though last-minute cargo bookings cost more and have fewer flight options. From high-risk countries a last-minute move is almost impossible because of the mandatory titer test waiting period. We recommend starting at least 8 weeks ahead.</p>,

    plain: 'Yes. The MOCCAE import requirements are the same for cats and dogs: an ISO microchip, rabies vaccination, the FVRCP core vaccines (rather than the dog\'s DHPPIL), an international health certificate, antiparasitic treatment, and the import permit. High-risk origin countries also require the rabies titer test for cats. The main difference is that cats do not face breed bans, so the eligibility check is simpler.',

    question: 'Are any cat breeds restricted in the UAE?',
    answer: <p>Cats do not face the same breed bans as dogs, but Savannah cats and Bengal cats are restricted unless they are at least five generations removed from their wild ancestor in the pedigree. Flat-faced cat breeds such as Persians, Himalayans, Exotic Shorthairs, British Shorthairs, and Scottish Folds are not banned, but like brachycephalic dogs they face airline heat restrictions during the summer embargo. We confirm your cat's eligibility before you start.</p>,

    question: 'Can my cat travel in the cabin?',
    answer: <p>No, not to Dubai. Like dogs, cats entering Dubai must travel as manifest cargo and cannot fly in the cabin or as checked baggage. The cargo hold on modern aircraft is pressurized and climate-controlled to 18–24°C, which is safe. We check the specific policy for your route and advise on the best, calmest option for your cat.</p>,

    question: 'How can I keep my cat calm during the move?',
    answer: <p>Cats are sensitive to stress, so preparation matters. Start crate familiarization 2–3 weeks ahead (longer for anxious cats), feed meals inside the carrier, and add a familiar blanket or a worn T-shirt with your scent. Calming pheromone sprays can help, but sedation is not recommended for air travel. Keeping the journey as direct as possible and avoiding the summer heat months also reduces stress.</p>,

    question: 'I need to move my pet during the summer embargo — what are my options?',
    answer: <><p>If the travel date falls in the May 1 to September 30 heat window, the airline decides whether cargo is accepted that day. Options that sometimes exist are an early cargo slot, a routing the carrier still operates, a person travelling with a pet the airline will accept in the cabin, boarding until the window opens, or a charter quoted before anyone books it. Each of those is priced for that pet and that date. None of them is a published package on this page.</p><p className="mt-3"><Link to="/guides/pet-travel-summer-dubai/" className="text-[#4F5BD5] font-semibold hover:underline inline-flex items-center gap-1">See the summer travel guide <ArrowRight className="w-3.5 h-3.5" /></Link></p></>,

    question: 'My flight was cancelled and my pet is stuck — what happens now?',
    answer: <p>If a flight is cancelled, the pet needs a safe place to wait and a new cargo booking that still fits the health certificate and, for an import, the 90-day permit. Boarding is arranged when the route needs it, and the cost is confirmed before it is booked. PawVIP includes contingency planning. It does not include a fixed number of free boarding days.</p>,

    question: 'My pet was refused entry at customs — what can be done?',
    answer: <p>Refusal at the port of entry is almost always caused by a documentation problem — a microchip number mismatch, an expired vaccine, a missing titer test, or a dog that resembles a banned breed. A pet with incomplete or incorrect documents can be refused entry, confiscated, or re-exported at the owner's expense, and breed decisions at the port are final. The file is checked against the current list before travel. If you are facing a refusal, message us immediately so we can work through the specific reason and the available options.</p>,

    answer: <p>MOCCAE import permits are valid for 90 days from issuance. If your permit will expire before travel, you must submit a new application and pay the current portal fee again. We track permit expiry dates against your travel timeline and set reminders for reapplication, so a permit lapse should never come as a surprise. If a delay has put your permit at risk, contact us and we will coordinate the renewal alongside your new travel date.</p>,
