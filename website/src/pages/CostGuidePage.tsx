              A pet that is already microchipped, with the rabies vaccine in the right order, skips those clinic steps. Starting from a first vaccine adds at least 21 days before travel, and a first vaccine or a gap needs at least 21 days before an antibody test. A missing document can mean refusal, a hold, or a return journey at the owner's expense.

            <strong>Important:</strong> Airlines use <strong>volumetric weight</strong>, not actual weight. A large crate takes up more cargo space than a small one, even if your pet is lean. We measure your pet's length (nose to base of tail) and height (floor to top of head, ears included) to size the crate precisely. An oversized crate costs you more in freight. An undersized one gets rejected at check-in.

            answer={
              <>
                <p>Pets travel as <strong>manifest cargo</strong>, not as baggage. This means they ride in a climate-controlled, pressurized section of the cargo hold — not in the passenger cabin. The fee covers:</p>
                <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm text-[#5A5A5A]">
                  <li>Dedicated cargo space (your pet's crate displaces freight that could have been sold)</li>
                  <li>Climate control and pressurization throughout the flight</li>
                  <li>Ground handling at both airports (check-in, loading, unloading, customs)</li>
                  <li>Insurance and liability coverage for live animals</li>
                  <li>IATA-compliant handling procedures</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-3">A pet's cargo ticket costs more than your economy seat because it requires specialized infrastructure, staff, and safety protocols. The good news: it's the safest way for pets to fly long distances.</p>

            question="Can I get a cheaper quote from a general moving company?"
            answer={
              <>
                <p>Sometimes — but rarely, and often with hidden costs. General movers (like ISS or Sparkle) treat pet relocation as a side business. Their quotes often exclude:</p>
                <ul className="mt-2 space-y-1 text-sm text-[#5A5A5A]">
                  <li>MOCCAE permit fees ("that's a government fee, not our problem")</li>
                  <li>IATA crate costs ("you can buy that yourself")</li>
                  <li>Customs clearance at destination ("you'll need to collect your pet from the airport")</li>
                  <li>Post-arrival registration ("we only handle the flight")</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="mt-3">By the time you add the missing pieces, the total usually exceeds our all-inclusive quote. Plus, a mover's priority is your furniture. Our priority is your pet. Every time.</p>

            question="What's the cheapest way to bring a pet to Dubai?"
            answer={
              <>
                <p>An owner can file a low-risk move when the microchip, rabies vaccine, health certificate, and permit are already in order. The clinic, the airline, and MOCCAE still invoice their own steps.</p>
                <p className="mt-3">A missed document or a rejected crate can hold the pet or force a new booking. The cost of that delay is whatever the kennel and the airline charge.</p>
                <p className="mt-3"><strong>PawPilot</strong> is document guidance. It is quoted after we know the pet and the route. It is not a published package, and it does not book the flight by itself.</p>
